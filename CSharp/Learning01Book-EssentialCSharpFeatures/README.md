# Introduction

In this learning we will follow Pro ASP.NET Core 6 9th edition Adam Freeman book, Chapter 05, Essential C# Features. You can find the book github repository [here.](https://github.com/apress/pro-asp.net-core-6). The book was written in 2022, so the last version of C# in 2022 year was C# 11. This means I think we will see some C# 10 features.
