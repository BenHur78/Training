# Steps
- A fat interface that does multiple things.
- Now we have a problem when we have a old printer that only supports printing and not scanning and other features.
- We can create a new interface that is more specific to the needs of the client.
- If we have a device that supports all features, we can have an interface that supports all features.

# What we learned here
- Create more atomic interfaces that are more specific to the needs of the client.
